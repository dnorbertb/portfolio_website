        content: "I took first steps in programming when I was 14. I was writing game plugins in PAWN and learning the basics of some programming languages ​​at school, and over time I also did courses on my own. For various reasons I had to take a break. I returned to programming and started learning web development. Everything was going very quickly, I tried many frameworks and tools such as: React, Vue, Astro, Next.js, Node.js, Express, CSS, SASS, TailwindCSS, Vuetify and others. The current level of knowledge lets me to learn new tools quickly. If I need something new, I check documentation, quick tutorials and I’m ready to go."

My adventure with IT began when I was 12 and since then I have learned a lot about different fields of IT. I serviced various electronic devices, like PC’s or mobile phones, configured networks, used various operating systems on VPS servers and PC computers. I have experience with Linux (Debian and Debian based, Manjaro, Arch), macOS and Windows.  I configured game servers, VPN servers, databases, hosted Node.js applications, using applications such as nginx and pm2. I did a lot of different things related to computer science that are simply too many to describe them all. I even coded controllers or worked with computer diagnostics of vehicles."

        content: "What I want to learn will mainly depend on what I will need at work, but I have already thought about it and I think I want to learn C# and Go. I also like creating mobile applications, I am currently working on one application in React Native but as I am an iPhone user, Swift need to definitely appear in my stack. I also plan to learn about Azure and other cloud related tools."

        content: "On the beginning I would like to say that my profiles and accounts on different websites may not look the best. The reason is that I am a practical person and the time I would have to spend on them, I prefer to spend on learning something new or writing more lines of code. As I mentioned earlier, I have a lot of different knowledge, which allows me to quickly understand and learn new things. While learning web development, I wanted to get to know as many different tools as possible, I didn't focus on anything specific because I want to specialize in that I will need at work. I am currently able to work with popular frameworks such as React, Vue2, Vue3, Next or Nuxt and I also think that I will quickly get into Angular (something I have already done, I know the concepts) if necessary. I still have a lot to learn but with my learning speed and experienced people around me I will be progressing very quickly."
